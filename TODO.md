# TODO: Make Categories Accessible Through Search Bar

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Update searchService.ts to include category names in searchable text
- [x] Modify enhanced-search-bar-with-suggestions.tsx to perform search when category is selected from suggestions
- [x] Make category cards in categories-section.tsx clickable to set category filter and perform search

## Summary
Categories are now fully accessible through the search bar:
- Typing category names directly finds items in that category
- Clicking category suggestions from the search bar filters results immediately
- Clicking category cards on the homepage sets the category filter and shows relevant items

## Next Steps
- Test the functionality to ensure search and filtering work correctly
- Consider adding visual feedback when category is active
- Potentially add a clear category button in the search bar
